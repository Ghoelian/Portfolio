# Portfolio
Some of my better, more advanced projects. These are personal projects that I've worked on outside of school.

# Dungeon Crawler
Just a simple dungeon crawler, where you can move around 2 levels (for now), pick up healing items, and fight enemies.

# Dungeon Crawler Editor
This is a level editor for the dungeon crawler. You can place walls with A, chests with S, enemies with D, the player with F and the exit with G. If you press enter, a 2-dimensional array will be printed out into the console. You can then copy this into the dungeon crawler as a level.
This one isn't usable as an executable, you need the console for the array it puts out.

# Match 4
Just a simple match 4 game.

# Matrix
I tried replicating the matrix rain effect. Doesn't look exactly like in the movies, but it's cool nonetheless.

# Pong
Pong

# Snake

# Transversion
This one isn't finished yet.
A remake of an old ZX Spectrum game.
