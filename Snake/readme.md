# Snake
This is a Snake game that I'm actually pretty proud of. There are some glitches, like a new piece of the tail spawning in the upper left corner, but as far as I know, those are things I can't help. It's something weird with Processing.

# Snake_Processing
This is a Processing sketch in which I initially made the game. You can download the executable inside and run it.

# Snake_JavaScript
I've ported the Processing version over to JavaScript with the P5.js library. Go to https://www.julianvos.nl/Snake/ or https://ghoelian.github.io (try GitHub first, if that one doesn't work, try my own website) to try it out.
